These scripts take your picture when you unlock your computer.

Requirements:
  bash
  mplayer
  jhead
  a working v4l2 compatible webcam

bin/watch-for-gnome-screensaver
  this will take a picture at some within a minute after the screensaver is unlocked.

Control with
    ctlwatchers start
    ctlwatchers stop
    ctlwatchers status
    ctlwatchers restart
    ctlwatchers start-if-not-running

The watch-for-* scripts will spawn bin/take-picture to actually take the
picture and they will be placed in the same dir that ctlwatchers exits.

You can put more scripts in bin named watch-for-foo and they will be started
by the control script.  Send me additional scripts for other events; pull
requests on github are welcome.

The image files will be named
    YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.png
    YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS (extra text).png
where the latter form is used if bin/take-picture is passed arguments to be the
"extra text".

Put something like the following in your crontab:

*/5 * * * * /home/dagar/Dropbox/Projects/picsofourlives/ctlwatchers start-if-not-running > /dev/null 2>&1

which will attempt to start it every 5 minutes.
